                <p>Thank you for visiting and shopping at Barsys LLC. Following are the terms and conditions
                    that constitute our Shipping Policy.<br></br></p>
                <h2>DELIVERY AND SHIPPING</h2>
                <p><span>All orders are subject to acceptance by Barsys, and any rejection of an order shall be
                        made in Barsysâ€™s sole discretion.&nbsp; If you have been charged for an order that is
                        subsequently rejected by&nbsp;Barsys,&nbsp;Basys will refund the amount of that order to
                        you, by a method chosen by&nbsp;Barsys in its sole and reasonable discretion.</span></p>
                <p><span>Barsys will make reasonable efforts to accommodate your delivery requirements; however,
                        delivery is subject to availability of resources at the time of order placement.&nbsp;
                        Barsys&nbsp;shall therefore not be liable in any way for any delay or damage arising
                        from&nbsp;Barsys's failure to meet your delivery requirements or any delivery
                        dates.</span></p>
                <p><span>All shipments shall be made from the facilities of Barsys&nbsp;or its distribution
                        center.&nbsp; Risk of loss for products shall pass to you upon delivery to the carrier,
                        and you are responsible for pursuing the carrier for any loss occurring in
                        transit.</span></p>
                <p><span>You are responsible for examining all shipments promptly upon receipt.&nbsp; If you
                        discover any shortages or incorrect products in the shipment, you must
                        notify&nbsp;Barsys immediately. Please check the order carefully, as no claim for
                        shortages or deficiencies will be accepted by Barsys after ten (10) days from delivery
                        of the products.</span></p>

                        be delayed by a few days. Please allow additional days in transit for delivery. If there
                        will be a significant delay in shipment of your order, we will contact you via email or
