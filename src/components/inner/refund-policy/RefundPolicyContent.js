                <h2>Damages and Issues</h2>
                <p>Please inspect your order upon reception and contact us immediately if the item is defective,
                    damaged or if you receive the wrong item, so that we can evaluate the issue and make it

                <h2>Exceptions / Non-Returnable items</h2>
                <p>Certain types of items cannot be returned, like perishable goods (such as food, flowers, or
                    plants), custom products (such as special orders or personalized items), and personal care
                    goods (such as beauty products). We also do not accept returns for hazardous materials,
                    flammable liquids, or gases. Please get in touch if you have questions or concerns about
                    your specific item. <br></br><br></br>Unfortunately, we cannot accept returns on sale items or gift
                    cards.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h2>Exchanges</h2>
                <p>The fastest way to ensure you get what you want is to return the item you have, and once the
                    return is accepted, make a separate purchase for the new item.</p>
